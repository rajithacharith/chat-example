#Basic Chat App Using Socket.io

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. 

This project is based on the tutorial at https://socket.io/get-started/chat/ .
